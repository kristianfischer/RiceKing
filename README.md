# RiceKing


This is a utility application I designed for iPhone and Android devices. It was coded in Dart using Flutter and VSCode. The purpose of the application is to specialize rice cooking. The user inputs the desired amount and type of rice they wish to have. To add some sophistication to the app, the user is able to "scan" their rice, allowing them to take a picture of the rice to get an update as to how far along it is. The first scan by the user begins the timer, and any subsequent scan delivers a message to the user via "RiceBot." An indicator also demonstrates visually how far along your rice is. Finally, the app delivers a push notification when your rice is half way done, as well as when it is finished. Never again must you worry about over or undercooking your rice, a common worry in the rice cooking community.
